# R Questions Tags on Stackoverflow

This script looks into **Stackoverflow's R-Questions** tags and explores relations. Questions are tagged with at least one tag, but the majority have more than one. For these questions, I will look into the occurance of pairs (e.g. ggplot2-histogram, or shiny-javascript,..etc.) and see the most frequent pairs. 

At the end, we will be able to make statements such as:

- **"shiny" appeared in x questions with "ggplot2"**  

- **"legend" is the 2nd most frequently mentioned tags with "ggplot2"**

- ...etc.

This could help identify the most frequently mentioned pairs of tags.
